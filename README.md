## Warning

Status: Looking for bugs to fix.

This theme was only tested on Gnome 3.6+.

The blur doesn't work, it uses transparency only.

## Installation

Make sure you have the "User Themes" extension turned on.

To install, copy the `Myopia` folder within `Variations` and paste it in `~/.local/share/themes` or `~/.themes`, and select the theme in Gnome Tweaks.

### Variations of this theme

There are some variations of this theme on the 'Variations' folder ;)

## Tweaking

Make sure to tweak themes inside the original Myopia-Theme repository.

You can customize colors, transparency and other stuff in the file `Settings.scss` (Inside the 'Tweaking' folder). For advanced tweaks, use the Advanced folder.

Then, inside the 'Tweaking' folder, open the terminal and type `./parse-sass.sh`, this will recreate the 'Myopia' folders in `Variations` with your new settings.

After all of these steps, follow the Installation guide to get your new Myopia customized theme ;)
